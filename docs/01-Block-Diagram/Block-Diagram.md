## Overview
The purpose of a block diagram is to help with the connections of the system. In a block diagram one can give a person a reasonable outline about why a part was chosen based on power levels, whether it was a sensor or actuator. A block diagram also helps with our team project which shows you where each board will be connected with the other team members.
